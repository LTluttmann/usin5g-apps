evaluation for an autonomous, electric transport vehicle fleet is developed in the form of an event-based simulation. The vehicles are modelled as independent agents. These agents process orders that represent a pickup-and-delivery-problem or a travelling-salesman-problem. Energy consumption, charging times, charging locations and the number of charging stations were taken into account. The analysis of different vehicle configurations shows that a sequenced activation in two groups increases the overall performance in certain scenarios. The simulation also shows that an unfavorable combination of order times and vehicle configuration results in a scenario in which a technically better equipped fleet fulfils fewer orders than a technically inferior fleet.
